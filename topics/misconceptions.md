# Misconceptions

Students don't come into programming as blank slates.  They have ideas about how code works based on previous experience, pop culture, and from completely un-related intuitions about the world.  This means that the main goal of an intro programming class isn't to build your students' understanding from scratch, it's actually to make sure that their existing understanding is correct!
