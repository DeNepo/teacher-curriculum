# Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Doing is not teaching and teaching is not doing.  That's nice to say, but what does it mean?

Performing a skill and teaching a skill are related, they both involve the same skill. Beyond that shared connection, doing and teaching require different skill sets and background knowledge.

When performing a skill (ie. being a developer) you need to know the deep ins-and-outs of the technologies and workflows you encounter.  Without this knowledge you won't be able to deliver and deliverables are the main objective.

When teaching a student to become a developer, you need to know _how students understand_ the technologies and workflows you are trying to teach.Without knowing how your students understand a topic it's impossible to correct their understanding and set them on the right learning path.  And learning is the main deliverable of teaching.

Understanding how your students understand is _Pedagogical Content Knowledge_.  A simple way to start thinking about PCK is to ask these two simple questions:

- If you were to complete the students' homework assignments, would you be able to intentionally make _the same_ mistakes your students will make?
- When you find a mistake in a student's assignment, are you able to infer how _they understand_ the code to work?
