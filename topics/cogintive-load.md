# Cognitive load

A mind can only remember/hold a specific number of things in memory at a time. Therefore we should be specific about what we teach, not overloading the mind the tasks and information it simply cannot hold in working memory.

The cognitive load theory gives us guidelines to design instructions that decrease extraneous cognitive load
