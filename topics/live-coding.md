Live coding is not so much about the solution but about the process.

"The solution seems to be to get the students to make a prediction before the demo." What happens when i run this function. What happens if i say type of to this thing. Make it interactive. https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/science-education-research/

I completely agree — live coding is more about process as it is outcome, and we *absolutely- should run the experiments to see what would happen. We can’t just assume that physics maps to CS. But I’d bet that the condition where you get students to predict what’s going to happen when you run the program, before running the program, would still have more learning value than just running the program. The work on self-explanations (e.g., Van Lehn, Chi, Pirolli) suggests that the average student doesn’t actually ask themselves, “Now, why did it work like that? How did I *think- it was going to work?” But we know that such self-explanations do students whole bunches of good with respect to learning. Prompting them to predict is likely triggering similar cognitive processes, getting them to analyze and explain a situation to themselves. - comment in this article https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/predicting-live-coding/
