Feedback from Magdalena Wojtakowska. A student at HYF that has worked as a teacher

Preparation

Do you plan?
How do you prepare?
Do you check in detail what it says in the lesson plan?
Do you know what you want to say/show/present?
Do you know how you want to say/show/present it?
Do you always remember most ss are total beginners?
Do you assume that when you start a new module, the previous ones have been executed 100%?
Do you assume that new concepts are intuitive to most people?
What do you think your role during the class is:
-to give a lecture and occassionally answer a question?
-only to guide and help having assumed that everyone is 100% prepared?
-involve ss in conversation? -make them interact? [YES, but in a controlled way]
-other? ...



During the lesson:

Clear goals:
Do you clearly say what they are and explain a few sentences how you are going to execute the lesson plan? If you don't, why?

Timing:
Have you planned how much time you want to spend on each step?
Do you regularly check the time?
What would you do if you didn't manage to do all the exercises and explain all the theory?

Lesson plan on GitHub and how you execute it in class:
Do you stick to it? Why? Why not?
Do you improvise? Why /why not?
Do you think your improvised spinoffs help to make the lesson more interesting or do they generate confusion?
Do you do a lot of ir/relevant spinoffs?
---> Don't. What to do instead? -you can send some links/.jsfiles /make a video after class.
Should ss have the right to take over during the lesson?
---> NOPE. You are in control! You know better and you have the right to stop the ss if they generate too much chaos.
Is the lesson proggressive when it comes to the level of difficulty?
---> If you stick to the plan on GitHub, it will be because the curriculum is great. 
Are you sure everything is done in baby steps?
---> How? Present/get feedback/present/get feedback... We'll get back to feedback soon.
Do you always wait till everyone is done with the task?
Do you think you should? Why /why not?
If you don't manage to explain the theory and do the exercises because there was not enough time, do you provide the ss with solutions?
Do you always solve ALL the exercises? -That should be a priority.
Do you discuss what to do in homework before the class ends? You should.
Do you sum up the lesson? (Intro--MainBody:TheoryAndExercises--Conclusions)

Communication:
How do you communicate with ss? 
How clear are your messages /instructions?
Do ss always know what to do? Can they navigate the lesson easily?
Do the ss know when to listen /do exercises /take notes?
Can everyone hear? Sure?
Can everyone see?
Do you keep jumping from window to window at a light speed? -DON't!
Do you realize it is impossible to follow and code along if it's too fast?
If you use the whiteboard: how do you assess your scribble and drawings? Are they beautiful? :> Would anyone be able to understand them or should you prepare sth in advance and send it before the lesson?


Feedback from the ss:
Do you check regularly during the class that everything you say is clear? If so, how?  
-Do you say 'is everything clear'/'are you following me'/'are you with me'/'does it make sense' etc? (If the ss don't answer clearly yes/no, do you move on?)
-Do you ask someone to repeat in their own words what you have just said and what it means? -ECHOOOOO!


Class notes/solutions/videos:
Are you sure you are recording? ARE YOU?
Are you sure that the audio is on? Can you double check?
Do you send ss the code transcript (from the lesson) on slack?  
Is is easy to use or is half of it commented out so that when you activate all code, it will throw errors in the console?
If so, can you always rename your variables and functions so that you don't have to comment out the code inn the first place? Yes, you can.
CAN WE HAVE SOLUTIONS TO HOMEWORK after we fail? :) Otherwise it will slow us down.
