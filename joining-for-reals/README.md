# Practical Stuff

So you want to do more than casually study this repo?  Here's what you need to know:

## "Enrolling"

Let us know you're interested and we'll invite you as a collaborator to the "coach-study" repo

> a way to track progress could be to have a separate repository with project boards.  this way the content (this repo) is separated from the tracking infrastructure

> this tracking repo could also be forkable, containing all of the instructions for homework submission & feedback & in-person workshops. so others can run it separately the way we do


## submitting assignments

create an issue on the project board for the learning path you want to follow

move your issue into the next assignment collumn when it's ready for review

if you've already completed an exercise because of another learning path, you can link to your old solution.  but it still needs to be reviewed again!  it may need adapting for the new path's context

## feedbacking assignments

you can only give feedback for assignments you've already had reviewed

use normal code-review to give feedback (isses, prs, ...)
