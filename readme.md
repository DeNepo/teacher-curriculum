# Teacher curriculum

One of the biggest parts of the education in HackYourFuture is our mentors teaching the students. That can be a daunting experience if you have not taught students before.

Therefore we have made a learning path for our mentors to become better teachers. Just like our students are put on a learning path when they enter HackYourFuture so should the mentors.

This repo serves as the curriculum for what the mentors should go through in order to become a certified HackYourFuture teacher™

## Curriculum

The curriculum does not need to be followed in a specific order but can be completed when there is time
 

### Assess class performance
This is linked with greater student performance

**Learning goals**
- Access a class from their homework
- Draw out misconceptions


**Exercises**
1. With a bunch of 7 homeworks, identify what this class struggle with
 - Write down a list of topics that needs to be retaught for this class
 - Come up with a strategy to puncture these misconceptions. Live coding, worked example, peer instruction.Write everything down.

2. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8). Do you think this can be applied to teaching software? What does that mean for our teaching? 
 
3. Create examples and questions that visualize the students misconceptions regarding promises.

**Preparation**
- Read this https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 
- Read this: `For debugging, I’m reminded of Beth Simon et al’s recent Peer Instruction work where she was deliberately constructing examples where students were likely to show a shallow or incomplete model of programming, e.g. they would have problems with loops that start at 1, or go backwards, or have less than vs less than or equal to end conditions. As I understand it, Simon et al said there was a fine art in example construction, to make sure it drew out common student misconceptions so that they could be discussed and corrected/` - https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong


### Guide the students in their learning process

Dont only teach a class. Let them work with exercises

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEmuEWjHr5c - Teacher should guide the social process of learning. inspire, challenge and excite. Not so much static teaching, more examples, exercises and misconception busting

"Learners make little progress when they’re watching your fingers dance over the keyboard, writing code and executing commands at what seems like impossible speed. They’ll quickly slip into a passive mode, watching things happen without truly understanding.

Unless they get hopelessly stuck, your student should drive the keyboard as much as humanly possible. Yes, this may mean painstakingly spelling aloud commands for them to type into the Terminal and that’s OK! They’ll still learn more than if you just do it for them." https://www.codementor.io/@npostolovski/how-to-teach-programming-pvgpdtoed


### Developing homework
Develop homework with varying degrees of scafolding - https://medium.com/luceresearchlab/what-should-cs-teachers-study-2c58a60ed12f


### Informatics teaching approaches

And when to use them. What is their pros and cons

#### Live coding

Live coding is not so much about the solution but about the process. 

##### Preparation
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buFRgtzfmiw general about live coding
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChLu2KfIAk4Slowing down when there are mistakes
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 Problem with live coding: Will they actually learn from passively watching live coding? 



"The solution seems to be to get the students to make a prediction before the demo." What happens when i run this function. What happens if i say type of to this thing. Make it interactive. https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/science-education-research/

I completely agree — live coding is more about process as it is outcome, and we *absolutely* should run the experiments to see what would happen. We can’t just assume that physics maps to CS. But I’d bet that the condition where you get students to predict what’s going to happen when you run the program, before running the program, would still have more learning value than just running the program. The work on self-explanations (e.g., Van Lehn, Chi, Pirolli) suggests that the average student doesn’t actually ask themselves, “Now, why did it work like that? How did I *think* it was going to work?” But we know that such self-explanations do students whole bunches of good with respect to learning. Prompting them to predict is likely triggering similar cognitive processes, getting them to analyze and explain a situation to themselves. - comment in this article https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/predicting-live-coding/


#### Peer instruction
- Mini-lecture 5 min
- Question
- Think. Write down answer yourself
- Response 1 with class
- Discuss with group
- Response 2
- Explain
- Concept step

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rixx-Qtnt5I

#### Pair programming


#### Worked examples


### Develop and execute lesson-plan
Preparation: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED566953.pdf

Develop a lesson-plan with exercises and code that should be written in class.

Execute the lesson-plan and reflect on how it went.


### Evaluation of a taught class
Make a retrospective on a module taught with your teacher assistant and homework helper. https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective

#### Teachers feedback
As part of the teacher learning path you will be giving feedback to two other teachers.

[Feedback instructions](feedback.md)

### Guide the students

#### The Basics of Pedagogy
- Mental models
- Cognitive load
- etc

#### Learning styles
- Analogists. These learners love analogies that relate programming concepts to real-world concepts they’re already familiar with. When I was first learning programming, it was helpful to think of a variable as being like a box with a name written on it. Similarly, it was helpful for me to think of methods/functions as recipes. For some learners a well-chosen analogy will help a concept to click almost immediately. Other learners will find talk of ‘boxes’ and ‘recipes’ incredibly confusing! Those learners fall into one of the two other styles. How to identify analogists: they’ll come up with their own analogies to explain things.
- Deep Divers. Some learners have an insatiable need to peek beneath the layers of abstraction and truly understand how things work. When introduced to the concept of variables, their first question will often be: how and where is the value of a variable stored? Hand-waving explanations simply won’t cut it for these learners. You’ll find that they regularly test your own computer science knowledge. If you don’t know the answer to one of their questions, take the time to research it. This will make you a better programmer. How to identify Deep Divers: they’ll ask lots of challenging questions. 
- Experimenters. Some learners want you to stop talking and let them try it out for themselves! They’ll learn about variables by testing things out on the command line, assigning and re-assigning variables, giving them weird names, and testing the limits of the system until they break. For these learners, an error message is a rewarding sign that they’ve learned one of the boundaries of the system. These students flourish when you give them the tools to experiment and get out of the way. How to identify experimenters: they start experimenting with a new concept before you’ve even finished explaining it to them.

#### Classroom approaches
- Cold calling https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-for-teachers-to-cold-call-students
- popcorning
- https://www.edutopia.org/blog/alternatives-to-round-robin-reading-todd-finley replace read with program
https://www.edunators.com/articles/classroom-strategies/5-alternatives-to-traditional-hand-raising-question-answer-strategies
- Put someone in "prison" if they ask too much. You cannot answer the next 30 minutes
- The people needing practice is the ones not getting it in cold calling. https://looneymathconsulting.com/blog-posts/2019/02/hand-raising-cold-calling-examining-efficacy-age-old-practices - There’s something deeply objectionable about saying “You have to talk when I say you should” 

Write an essay about when to use different teaching methods

#### Effective mentoring




## Notes 
Everything could be split up in 
- Classroom
- After classroom
- Before classroom
- Mentoring students etc

### Problem solving strategies should this be included??
- Formalization
- Decomposing a problem into sub-problems
- Abstraction
- Top-down design, bottom-up design, 
- Gradual refinement
- Generalization
- Analogy

Any good articles??
