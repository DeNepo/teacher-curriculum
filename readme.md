# Teacher curriculum

One of the biggest parts of the education in HackYourFuture is our mentors teaching the students. That can be a daunting experience if you have not taught students before.

Therefore we have made a learning path for our mentors to become better teachers. Just like our students are put on a learning path when they enter HackYourFuture so should the mentors.

This repo serves as the curriculum for what the mentors should go through in order to become a certified HackYourFuture teacherâ„¢

## Curriculum

The curriculum does not need to be followed in a specific order but can be completed when there is time

### Teachers feedback
As part of the teacher learning path you will be giving feedback to two other teachers.

### Retrospective on a module taught

### Reading a class
What is their need

### Notes
- But teaching is much more complicated. It is widely thought that it is not the job of the teacher to "transfer" knowledge to the students, but instead get the students to do the explaining. - Niels gregersen

- Most effective science teachers also know what students get wrong https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong/ maybe the teachers should through the homework be able to figure out what students are mostly struggling with! Coule be easily made into an exercise. First identify what this class struggles with, give the teacher 6 homeworks to look through. Now come up with a plan/worked example/live coding to help the students understand this problem

- Would it be nice to let the students explain where they are weakest, maybe even mentors writing it down
