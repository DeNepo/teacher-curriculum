# Teacher curriculum

One of the biggest parts of the education in HackYourFuture is our mentors teaching the students. That can be a daunting experience if you have not taught students before.

Therefore we have made a learning path for our mentors to become better teachers. Just like our students are put on a learning path when they enter HackYourFuture so should the mentors.

This repo serves as the curriculum for what the mentors should go through in order to become a certified HackYourFuture teacherâ„¢

## Curriculum

### Notes
But teaching is much more complicated. It is widely thought that it is not the job of the teacher to "transfer" knowledge to the students, but instead get the students to do the explaining. - Niels gregersen
