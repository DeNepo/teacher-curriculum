# Teacher curriculum

One of the biggest parts of the education in HackYourFuture is our mentors teaching the students. That can be a daunting experience if you have not taught students before.

Therefore we have made a learning path for our mentors to become better teachers. Just like our students are put on a learning path when they enter HackYourFuture so should the mentors.

This repo serves as the curriculum for what the mentors should go through in order to become a certified HackYourFuture teacherâ„¢
