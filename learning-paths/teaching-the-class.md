## Getting Started

Welcome!  come learn some practical tips for leading class at HYF.  Take a look over the module's learning objectives, when you've read the provided links

This learning path is the meat and potatoes of teaching. Its focus on practical topics that will help you as a mentor with more tools for approaching the class.

You will learn about science based teaching approaches, how to evaluate a class' performance and how to execute a lesson plan.


### Teaching Programming at HYF

- it helps to think of HYF as a self-study course with some extra help, instead of as a taught course with more self-study

### Practical tips and tricks

- Keep the time
- Discuss how to do the next homework before class ends
- Is there an alternative to solving homework in start of class. know exactly why you are doing it

### Students prepare a mini-presentation

It might be worth to encourage to prepare mini presentations in groups before each lesson but that might not work as I know how hard it to synchronize schedules. Ideally, I'd love to read about a concept, discuss it with someone from my group before the class and present it during the lesson while getting live feedback from the mentors. That would strip naked all the chaos that is generated in our heads when we think we understand but we really don't :wink: - Magdalena Wojtakowska
- this could be more realistic as a homework assignment, to summarize in small what they saw in class using their own words.
- added bonus.  a history of these will help future coaches catch up on past student misconceptions

## Project

As a final project for this learning path you will ... wait for it ... teach a class! When you fill out the issue for this project include these 5 things.  They can be hosted however however you like, please just provide a link and quick summary for each item directly in the issue.  Your fellow coaches should spend their time reviewing your work, not finding it :)

### Lesson Specs

- What can you expect students to know before the lesson starts? This will be based on what they saw in previous modules.
- What do you expect students to learn _during class time_? (ie. what would you put on a quiz to hand out at 16h after class)
- What is a student's next step after class ends to get started with the week's assignments?
- What are your practical constraints? (ie. time constraints, classroom materials like projectors or a whiteboard, your personal knowledge of the material, ...)

### Prep Notes

> Written _before_ you taught the class!

Share the planning process you went through before the class and your prep notes for in class.  This can be in any format, just link to it in your issue.

### Class Recording

If possible, provide a recording of your class session.

### Feedback

Ask your students and fellow coaches for feedback and include a link to the feedback in your issue.  This could be a google form, a copy-pasted collection of slack messages, or any other collection of feedback.

### Reflection

Look back over the entire process (planning, execution, feedback) and reflect on what went well and what didn't.  Make a special effort to compare what you expected in your prep notes to the feedback you received.

- Did students learn what you'd intended?
- How did peer interactions effect what you had planned?
- How well do you think you adapted to your class' needs?

### Lessons Learned

Send a pull request to the `Tips and Tricks` section of this GitBook with at least one practical piece of advice you learned through this process. Link your PR to this issue.
