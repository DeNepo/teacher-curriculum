## Getting Started

Welcome!  come learn some practical tips for leading class at HYF.  Take a look over the module's learning objectives, when you've read the provided links

This learning path is the meat and potatoes of teaching. Its focus on practical topics that will help you as a mentor with more tools for approaching the class. 

You will learn about science based teaching approaches, how to evaluate a class' performance and how to execute a lesson plan. 


### Teaching Programming at HYF

- it helps to think of HYF as a self-study course with some extra help, instead of as a taught course with more self-study

### Practical tips and tricks

- Keep the time
- Discuss how to do the next homework before class ends
- Is there an alternative to solving homework in start of class. know exactly why you are doing it



### Students prepare a mini-presentation

It might be worth to encourage to prepare mini presentations in groups before each lesson but that might not work as I know how hard it to synchronize schedules. Ideally, I'd love to read about a concept, discuss it with someone from my group before the class and present it during the lesson while getting live feedback from the mentors. That would strip naked all the chaos that is generated in our heads when we think we understand but we really don't :wink: - Magdalena Wojtakowska
- this could be more realistic as a homework assignment, to summarize in small what they saw in class using their own words.
- added bonus.  a history of these will help future coaches catch up on past student misconceptions
