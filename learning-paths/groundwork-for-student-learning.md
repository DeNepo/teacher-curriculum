### How students/people learn

#### Learning styles
- Analogists. These learners love analogies that relate programming concepts to real-world concepts they’re already familiar with. When I was first learning programming, it was helpful to think of a variable as being like a box with a name written on it. Similarly, it was helpful for me to think of methods/functions as recipes. For some learners a well-chosen analogy will help a concept to click almost immediately. Other learners will find talk of ‘boxes’ and ‘recipes’ incredibly confusing! Those learners fall into one of the two other styles. How to identify analogists: they’ll come up with their own analogies to explain things.
- Deep Divers. Some learners have an insatiable need to peek beneath the layers of abstraction and truly understand how things work. When introduced to the concept of variables, their first question will often be: how and where is the value of a variable stored? Hand-waving explanations simply won’t cut it for these learners. You’ll find that they regularly test your own computer science knowledge. If you don’t know the answer to one of their questions, take the time to research it. This will make you a better programmer. How to identify Deep Divers: they’ll ask lots of challenging questions.
- Experimenters. Some learners want you to stop talking and let them try it out for themselves! They’ll learn about variables by testing things out on the command line, assigning and re-assigning variables, giving them weird names, and testing the limits of the system until they break. For these learners, an error message is a rewarding sign that they’ve learned one of the boundaries of the system. These students flourish when you give them the tools to experiment and get out of the way. How to identify experimenters: they start experimenting with a new concept before you’ve even finished explaining it to them.


### Motivating students

### Problem solving strategies
- Formalization
- Decomposing a problem into sub-problems
- Abstraction
- Top-down design, bottom-up design,
- Gradual refinement
- Generalization
- Analogy

### The Basics of Pedagogy
- Mental models
- Cognitive load
- etc

## Final Project

Each learning path can have a final project that is unique to this learning path.

it integrates what was learned in the exercises/readings and can act as a final assessment
