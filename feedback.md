# Feedback

Giving feedback to others as you probably know is super good for reflecting about your own teaching

## So what do i exactly need to do
Give feedback to **two different teachers** 

- Before you sit in make sure to let the teacher know that you will be there giving feedback
- Sit in on one of their classes and take notes about the teaching
  - [Here is a list](#what-should-i-be-looking-for) of thing to look for when taking notes
  - Remember to [give good feedback](what-to-consider-when-giving-feedback). Everyone is a volunteer and are doing their best, so please be nice :)
- When the class is done spend some time going through the feedback
  - Suggest some clear changes the mentor can work on


## What should i be looking for?
- How is the time between teaching and exercises divided?
- Are things cearly exlained?
- Do the students follow the pace of the teaching?
- Were are the learning goals taught?
- Were the student involved?

## What to consider when giving feedback
1. Be positive. Focus on what the person is doing well when giving feedback (and not just what they can improve upon).
1. Focus on the behavior, not the person. When discussing a problem with performance, keep your emotions in check. Focus on the actions of the individual, not the person.
1. Be specific. Provide tangible examples of the behavior in question, not vague, “drive by” criticism like, “You’ve been arguing with customers a lot” or “I’ve been hearing complaints about your attitude”
1. Be timely. Don’t wait until the employee’s annual performance appraisal to provide positive or negative feedback. The closer feedback is tied to the behavior in question (good or bad) the more powerful it will be.
1. Make sure you are clear on why you are delivering the feedback. Often, feedback comes from judgment and we don’t want to pass it off as feedback. So, it’s important to pause and think about where the feedback is coming from and how can you deliver it in a way that will be received positively.
1. Don’t use judgment as a means for feedback. Don’t use feedback as a cover for you to share an actual judgment or be critical of another person. Judgment is just your opinion of a person’s character and isn’t neutral.
1. Provide feedback from a neutral place. Feedback is really a piece of information or observation you are sharing. Once a person receives the feedback from a neutral space, the person can decide to change or not.
1. Make it a two-way conversation. Take time to engage the employee and check for understanding. Focus on “partnership,” not “this is what you’re doing wrong” or “this is what you need to change.”
1. Follow up. If your feedback concerns a problem, look for opportunities to “catch them doing it right.” Reinforce positive behavior.
1. Make sure you have these three qualities before delivering feedback. Feedback can best be received when you have the authority, credibility and trust already established in the relationship. Without these three things, it makes it more difficult to receive the feedback.
