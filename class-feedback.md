# Giving feedback to teachers

## Introduction


There are two parts of giving feedback:
1. Observing how the class in being run
2. Giving feedback to the mentor regarding your observations

## Observing how the class in being run

Here you can use one super important guideline which is to **put yourself in the shoes of the students**. Try and imagine that it is you being taught. 

With this mindset try and observe


**Student interaction**
- Are the students frustrated, tired, happy excited, nervous, other?
- How is the atmosphere in the class? 
- Are the students interacting with each other or just sitting on their own computer

**Teaching**
- How is the flow of what is being taught? 
- Is there a good structure to it?
- Do they understand the class/exercise/homework
- Is the teacher communicating clearly
- Is he understandable?
- How is the interaction between the teacher and assistant?
- Is the teacher being nice to the students
- Is he acknowledging their questions? 
- Is the teaching interactive (is he asking the students questions)?

**Teaching environment**
- How warm is it? 
- Is it humid?
- Is there fresh air?
- Is the lights turned on/off?
- When was the last break?

Some of these things are easy to check. Others are a little harder. Just remember that you can always just ask the students. Off course you dont need to check every single topic here, just use it as a guideline

**How is time spent in class?**

This is a very important guideline for giving feedback in the class. But simply observe how the time in class is being used. 

- Is the teacher talking most of the time?
- Do the students have time for exercises?
- Does the teacher use too long time answering questions?
- Is the teacher using the time at his disposal in the best possible way?

## Giving feedback to the mentor regarding your observations

**Don't be too negative**
The mentors are volunteers and we want them to feel good about teaching here. Try and focus on what they can improve.

**Focus on the action not the person**
We want to point to what we observed and why that was a problem for the students. Dont say: You are a lazy teacher and the students were super annoyed. Instead say: The exercise you did was not properly prepared, this led to lots of confusion for the students. 

**Keep it at 3 points**
If there is too much feedback then it can be hard to know what to work on as a teacher. It might also feel a little discouraging. 3 points is what i have found works best.

**Always say something positive**
Again the teachers are volunteer teachers that use their free time to help people grow. So please make them feel good about teaching :) 

**Give something concrete the teacher can work with until next class**
Here are some examples: Try minimizing the number of times you are changing windows. Try focus on acknowledging questions coming from the students. Try have more breaks for next Sunday.

## Example

This is a real example of some feedback i gave

Hey mentor...
I just wanted to write some feedback on yesterdays lecture :slightly_smiling_face:
You have a really pleasant way to teach and it affects the students in a really good way! There was a good mood in the class, people were laughing and having a good time.
I also heard you respond to the student asking about telling the directory of the terminal. But you had a very precise and thoughtful answer where you also acknowledged him asking the question. Great stuff!

Think about being clearer when you give exercises. Be Extremely clear (way more than you think is necessary). The students in the class were struggling with basic things like cloning the right repo, working in the right folder (nodejs/week2/exercise-template), copying the right file (should it be movies.js or movies.json) and understanding the question. A lot of times i would come to some students and i first asked what problem they were solving. They had a hard time explaining that.

A smaller thing that i saw is that you are changing windows quite a lot when teaching. Try for Sunday to think about it minimizing the number of times you change window, or maybe have fewer windows open
