# Giving feedback to teachers

## Introduction


There are two parts of giving feedback:
1. Observing how the class in being run
2. Giving feedback to the mentor regarding your observations

## Observing how the class in being run

Here you can use one super important guideline which is to **put yourself in the shoes of the students**. Try and imagine that it is you being taught. 

With this mindset try and observe


**Student interaction**
- Are the students frustrated, tired, happy excited, nervous, other?
- How is the atmosphere in the class? 
- Are the students interacting or just sitting on their own computer

**Teaching**
- How is the flow of what is being taught? 
- Is there a good structure to it?
- Do they understand the class/exercise/homework
- Is the teacher communicating clearly. 
- Is he understandable?
- How is the interaction between the teacher and assistant?
- Is the teacher being nice to the students. 
- Is he acknowledging their questions? 
- Is he involving the class in his teachings? 
- Is The teaching interactive?

**Teaching environment**
- How warm is it? 
- Is it humid?
- Is there fresh air?
- Is the lights turned on/off?
- When was the last break?

Some of these things are easy to check. Others are a little harder. Just remember that you can always just ask the students. Off course you dont need to check every single topic here, just use it as a guideling

**How is time spent in class?**

This is a very important guideline for giving feedback in the class. But simply observe how the time in class is being used. 

- Is the teacher talking most of the time?
- Do the students have time for exercises?
- Can the teacher fall down a explainer hole when asked a question?
- Is the teacher using the time at his disposal in the best possible way?
