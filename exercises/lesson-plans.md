## Lesson Plan Exercises

Read, Modify, Create.  This is helpful for students, and if you're here the teacher has become a student :)

Here are 3 exercises to help you master lesson plans:

1. Choose the lesson plans for one module and analyze them.
    1. How well is each lesson plan structured and described? Is it clear enough for a new coach to teach?
    2. How well does each Sunday fit in it's week?  Does the prep work really prepare?  Do the assignments build on the lesson?
    3. How well do the lessons in this module relate? do they have a clear conceptual integrity? do the build well on each other?
2. Send a pull request to an HYF module of your choice suggesting changes for the lesson plans.
3. Create your own lesson plan for a module that needs help, or create a new master class for alumni on a technology of your choosing.

All done with these exercises and want to keep practicing?  Give feedback to another coach's Lesson Plan exercises!
