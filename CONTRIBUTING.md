## How to contribute to the HYF Teacher Curriculum

### Did you find a mistake?

- Ensure the mistake was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/teacher-curriculum/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](hhttps://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/teacher-curriculum/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a suggested correction.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a mistake?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Formatting, layout, and other cosmetic patches are welcome. Please label these issues `layout`

### Do you intend to add a new chapter or section, or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change with an issue labeled `content` so everyone can discuss it.

### Do you have questions about the design or content of the course?

- Open an issue labeled `question`.

### Do you want to contribute to the curriculum?
