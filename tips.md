# Tips

## Good questions to ask
- Good questions to ask Is there anything we’ve covered that you feel you don’t understand as well as you need? 
- Is there anything we’ve covered where you don’t see why it is important or useful? 
- Do you feel like what we’re working on now is helping you progress toward your goals? 
- Is there anything we haven’t covered that you’d like to learn about?
- How is the pacing for you? Too fast? Too slow? Just right?
