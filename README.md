# Teacher curriculum

> [gitbook outline](https://hyfbe.gitbook.io/teacher-curriculum/)

One of the biggest parts of the education in HackYourFuture is our mentors teaching the students. That can be a daunting experience if you have not taught students before.

Therefore we have made a learning path for our mentors to become better teachers. Just like our students are put on a learning path when they enter HackYourFuture so should the mentors.

This repo serves as the curriculum for what the mentors should go through in order to become a certified HackYourFuture teacher™

The curriculum does not need to be followed in a specific order but can be completed when there is time

## Overview

SHOULD WE HAVE A CATEGORY ONLY CALLED MENTORING STUDENTS???
- by mentoring you mean longer-term support of individual students? this could be a separate module

![Teacher curriculum overview](teacher-curriculum-overview.png)

---

## Topics

The section in this GitBook called "topics" is a collections of concepts and techniques in education that are helpful for teaching programming.

If you only have a few minutes here and there, dive into the topics!  You can learn something interesting and helpful in any short amount of time.

---

## Exercises

Looking to go a little deeper and get some hands-on experience with the topics discussed above?  Take a look through the exercises!

Each exercise focuses on a particular skill you'll need as a coach.  You'll practice creating class materials, evaluating assignments, an much more.

But wait! Exercises are for practice, repetition, and redundancy. When you find the exercise you want to work on, finish it more than once!  Say you're practicing "_creating worked examples_", well then write 5 or 6.  Would you ever tell a student they only need to solve one coding challenge and they're good to go?

## Learning Paths

You're into it?  You've got a few hours a week and want to get really good at teaching programming?  check out the learning paths.

Each learning path is a collection of topics & exercises that fit together to build a more complete skills set.

At the end of each learning path is a main project integrating everything you practiced along the way.

---

## Joining for Reals

Do you like learning together?  Looking to share your experience with other coaches?  Get in touch with us and we can invite you as a contributor to our _teacher-training_ repository.

There you can track your progress through the learning paths on the repository project boards, give and receive feedback, and find others' interested in learning the same skills.

## Students learning

### The Basics of Pedagogy
- Mental models
- Cognitive load
- etc


### Learning styles
- Analogists. These learners love analogies that relate programming concepts to real-world concepts they’re already familiar with. When I was first learning programming, it was helpful to think of a variable as being like a box with a name written on it. Similarly, it was helpful for me to think of methods/functions as recipes. For some learners a well-chosen analogy will help a concept to click almost immediately. Other learners will find talk of ‘boxes’ and ‘recipes’ incredibly confusing! Those learners fall into one of the two other styles. How to identify analogists: they’ll come up with their own analogies to explain things.
- Deep Divers. Some learners have an insatiable need to peek beneath the layers of abstraction and truly understand how things work. When introduced to the concept of variables, their first question will often be: how and where is the value of a variable stored? Hand-waving explanations simply won’t cut it for these learners. You’ll find that they regularly test your own computer science knowledge. If you don’t know the answer to one of their questions, take the time to research it. This will make you a better programmer. How to identify Deep Divers: they’ll ask lots of challenging questions.
- Experimenters. Some learners want you to stop talking and let them try it out for themselves! They’ll learn about variables by testing things out on the command line, assigning and re-assigning variables, giving them weird names, and testing the limits of the system until they break. For these learners, an error message is a rewarding sign that they’ve learned one of the boundaries of the system. These students flourish when you give them the tools to experiment and get out of the way. How to identify experimenters: they start experimenting with a new concept before you’ve even finished explaining it to them.


### Effective mentoring

## Teaching the class

[module folder](./modules/teaching-the-class)

How to write a lesson plan, teach a class, and measure your success.


## After the class

### Developing homework
Develop homework with varying degrees of scafolding - https://medium.com/luceresearchlab/what-should-cs-teachers-study-2c58a60ed12f


### Evaluation of a taught class
Make a retrospective on a module taught with your teacher assistant and homework helper. https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective

### Teachers feedback
As part of the teacher learning path you will be giving feedback to two other teachers.

[Feedback instructions](feedback.md)


### Homework review
Present coaches with a mock student assignment. have them provide a code review


### Problem solving strategies should this be included??
- Formalization
- Decomposing a problem into sub-problems
- Abstraction
- Top-down design, bottom-up design,
- Gradual refinement
- Generalization
- Analogy

Any good articles??
