### Assess class performance
This is linked with greater student performance

**Learning goals**
- Access a class from their homework
- Draw out misconceptions

**Preparation**
- Read this https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 
- Read this: `For debugging, I’m reminded of Beth Simon et al’s recent Peer Instruction work where she was deliberately constructing examples where students were likely to show a shallow or incomplete model of programming, e.g. they would have problems with loops that start at 1, or go backwards, or have less than vs less than or equal to end conditions. As I understand it, Simon et al said there was a fine art in example construction, to make sure it drew out common student misconceptions so that they could be discussed and corrected/` - https://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/the-critical-part-of-pck-what-students-get-wrong


**Exercises**
1. With a bunch of 7 homeworks, identify what this class struggle with
 - Write down a list of topics that needs to be retaught for this class
 - Come up with a strategy to puncture these misconceptions. Live coding, worked example, peer instruction.Write everything down.

2. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8). Do you think this can be applied to teaching software? What does that mean for our teaching? 
 
3. Create examples and questions that visualize the students misconceptions regarding promises.
