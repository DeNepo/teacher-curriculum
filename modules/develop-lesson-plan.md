# Develop and execute lesson-plan

**Learning goals**
- Learn to scope learning objectives to fit within your students' levels and the lesson length
- Learn how to develop a lesson-plan based on your learning objectives
- Evaluate the lesson-plan

**Lesson Schedule**
* Motivate, isolate, practice, integrate:
  * [the original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2674683.2674690) (the talk about paradigms is not relevant right now)
  * a lesson plan based on this pattern - [async programming week 1](https://hackyourfuture.be/asynchronous-programming/week-1/#/)

**Exercises**

1. Using some of the techniques in [Informatics teaching approaches](#informatics-teaching-approaches) develop a full lesson-plan for a class you are teaching
- After class reflect on how the lesson-plan worked out
 - What went well?
 - What could have been improved?
 - What in the lesson-plan would you change for next time?
 - Is there something that the next mentor would benefit from knowing?
