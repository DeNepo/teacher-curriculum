# Develop and execute lesson-plan

**Learning goals**
- Learn to scope learning goals to fit within your students' levels and the lesson length
- Learn how to develop a lesson-plan based on your learning goals
- Evaluate the lesson-plan

**Lesson Schedule**
* Motivate, isolate, practice, integrate:
  * [the original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2674683.2674690) (the talk about paradigms is not relevant right now)
  * a lesson plan based on this pattern - [async programming week 1](https://hackyourfuture.be/asynchronous-programming/week-1/#/)

**Preparation**

**Exercises**

1. Using some of the techniques in [Informatics teaching approaches](#informatics-teaching-approaches) develop a full lesson-plan for a class you are teaching
- After class reflect on how the lesson-plan worked out
 - What went well?
 - What could have been improved?
 - What in the lesson-plan would you change for next time?
 - Is there something that the next mentor would benefit from knowing?


**Module Assignments**
* (ideas of what an assignment could be like)
* Given these constraints, create a lesson plan:
  * Students have already learned `class`es, `fetch`, DOM manipulation and pair programming
  * Students are expected to learn how to send POST requests to a RESTful API
  * Class will be 4 hours long, in person
  * Your lesson plan must include: a slide show, a set of exercises, an in-class project, a homework assignment, and assessment criteria for the homework assignment
  * Possible points of confusion in your lesson plan
* Given a lesson plan (without homework assignment or prep work), identify:
  * What a student would need to have learned before attending this lesson
  * Possible points of confusion in this lesson plan
  * Write a homework assignment & assessment strategy for this lesson plan
  * Assign prep work for this lesson plan
