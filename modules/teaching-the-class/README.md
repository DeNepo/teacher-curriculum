## Getting Started

(keep this part light in links so it can be a quick overview.  depth+links go under key concepts)

### Teaching

- PCK
- Misconceptions

### Teaching Programming


### Teaching Programming at HYF


- it helps to think of HYF as a self-study course with some extra help, instead of as a taught course with more self-study


----

## Key Concepts

(these could each become separate markdowns)

### Lesson Plan "Specs"

> this list intentionally refers to what a student can _do_ instead of what they _know_.

- What can students do before the lesson starts?
- What are the learning objectives _for class time_?
- What does a student need to do after the lesson?
- What are your practical constraints?

One of the most helpful things you can do for students is to be very clear about what they are expected to learn _in class_ with your guidance, and what they are expected to learn on their own afterwards.   ie. are you talking about static methods right now because you expect students to be able to use them by the end of class, or because they should know it's important for when they study at home?

Being very clear about what is expected before vs. during vs. after class will help you prepare, and help students concentrate their efforts (and manage their stress ;)

## Classroom Culture


## Preparing for class

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buFRgtzfmiw general about live coding
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChLu2KfIAk4Slowing down when there are mistakes
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8 Problem with live coding: Will they actually learn from passively watching live coding?

### Misconceptions

what are common student mistakes and misconceptions for the subject you're teaching?  the leanest way to figure this out is to read through old student assignments for the week.  If you have more time you can get in touch with past coaches or students to find out what concepts were hardest to grasp


### Worked examples


### Flipped classroom

#### Preparation
- Read these two articles about flipped classroom [1](https://elearning.dtu.dk/TEACH/Flipped-Classroom) and [2](https://www.panopto.com/blog/what-is-a-flipped-classroom/)
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1MKpyVPilI) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI8XqRDB8v4) about what if sutdents dont watch the videos

#### Exercise
- When do you think it makes sense to use flipped classroom? What are the pros and cons?
- Prepare flipped classroom for a specific topic. The preparation should include
  - Online lecture - could be uploaded to youtube
  - Class work. What should be done in the class? Discussion, exercise, homework? Up to you. Write a plan for what should be done in the class
  

### Peer instruction

- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9orbxoRofI7) giving some context peer instructed learning
- Read [this article](https://elearning.dtu.dk/TEACH/Peer-Instruction) on how to set up peer instructed learning
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiD4YBr8F4o) also about what peer instructed learning is
- Read [this article](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/tls/sites/rit.edu.academicaffairs.tls/files/docs/te-peerinstruct-concept.pdf) about creating a good concept question
- A little about [pdf](https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/tls/sites/rit.edu.academicaffairs.tls/files/docs/te-peerinstruct-facilitate.pdf) about facilitating peer review

If you really want to go deep read [this](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.14-11-0198) (takes about 5 minutes to skim)

__Discussion Questions__

1. Why do you think peer instruction has been shown increase learning?
1. When would you use peer instructed learning? When would you not?
1. Plan and execute a peer instruction session with a class you are teaching. Describe the process. Fx what concept did you teach, what concept question did you ask, what were the possible answers.
1. What went well, what did not go so well. Would you do it again?


### Pair programming

- Read about the benefits of pair programming [here](https://meetedison.com/pair-programming-in-education/)
- What [this video]( https://youtu.be/TWj78n4ZuMY) about some tips for pair porgramming


these things don't just happen. set it up to help them!

### Communicating the goals


## classroom approach

- Cold calling https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-for-teachers-to-cold-call-students
- popcorning
- https://www.edutopia.org/blog/alternatives-to-round-robin-reading-todd-finley replace read with program
https://www.edunators.com/articles/classroom-strategies/5-alternatives-to-traditional-hand-raising-question-answer-strategies
- Put someone in "prison" if they ask too much. You cannot answer the next 30 minutes
- The people needing practice is the ones not getting it in cold calling. https://looneymathconsulting.com/blog-posts/2019/02/hand-raising-cold-calling-examining-efficacy-age-old-practices - There’s something deeply objectionable about saying “You have to talk when I say you should”

Write an essay about when to use different teaching methods

### Peer instruction

this doesn't just happen!  time you spend

- [Peer Instruction for Active Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9orbxoRofI)
- julie schell (practical tips) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rixx-Qtnt5I
  - 7 steps. strictly following this is a bit much to ask for hyf

- Mini-lecture 5 min
- Question
- Think. Write down answer yourself
- Response 1 with class
- Discuss with group
- Response 2
- Explain
- Concept step

### Draw out misconceptions

## Assess class performance
This is linked with greater student performance

### Worked examples

### Informatics teaching approaches

And when to use them. What is their pros and cons

### Project/problem based learning

applied projects can be very helpful for students, but that's not guarenteed.  Without the proper support project based learning can slow down or even hamper learning in the long run.  Especially at HYF where students spend most of their study time alone with out the guidance of a coach or peers, there is a good chance that an open-ended project-based learning approach is not going to work very well.

simple things you can do to help students learn the most from projects are:


### Live coding

Live coding is not so much about the solution but about the process.

"The solution seems to be to get the students to make a prediction before the demo." What happens when i run this function. What happens if i say type of to this thing. Make it interactive. https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/science-education-research/

I completely agree — live coding is more about process as it is outcome, and we *absolutely- should run the experiments to see what would happen. We can’t just assume that physics maps to CS. But I’d bet that the condition where you get students to predict what’s going to happen when you run the program, before running the program, would still have more learning value than just running the program. The work on self-explanations (e.g., Van Lehn, Chi, Pirolli) suggests that the average student doesn’t actually ask themselves, “Now, why did it work like that? How did I *think- it was going to work?” But we know that such self-explanations do students whole bunches of good with respect to learning. Prompting them to predict is likely triggering similar cognitive processes, getting them to analyze and explain a situation to themselves. - comment in this article https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/predicting-live-coding/


### Practical tips and tricks

- Keep the time
- Discuss how to do the next homework before class ends
- Is there an alternative to solving homework in start of class. know exactly why you are doing it

## Student follow-up

### Assess class performance


### Students prepare a mini-presentation

It might be worth to encourage to prepare mini presentations in groups before each lesson but that might not work as I know how hard it to synchronize schedules. Ideally, I'd love to read about a concept, discuss it with someone from my group before the class and present it during the lesson while getting live feedback from the mentors. That would strip naked all the chaos that is generated in our heads when we think we understand but we really don't :wink: - Magdalena Wojtakowska
- this could be more realistic as a homework assignment, to summarize in small what they saw in class using their own words.
- added bonus.  a history of these will help future coaches catch up on past student misconceptions

## Assignments

So you think this all makes sense?  Move on to the assignments! (if this is how we do homework)  Create a new issue in the project board for your next assignment and get rolling.

### Prepare to teach an existing lesson plan

> so they focus on the teaching not the tech, we should let coaches choose any lesson plan they want from the hyf course.  html/css, databases, js, ...

this assignment could be a template markdown file where coaches have to fill in their prep work and link to any resources (worked examples, videos, slides, ...) they prepared for class.

A big plus of this assignment format is coaches can directly use the same template to prepare for the next module they teach.
